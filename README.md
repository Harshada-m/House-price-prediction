Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task.

House prices increase every year, so there is a need
for a system to predict house prices in the future. House price
prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a
house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to
purchase a house. There are three factors that influence the price
of a house which include physical conditions, concept and
location. 

# Linear Regression

We are living in the era of large amounts of data, powerful computers, and artificial intelligence. This is just the beginning. Data science and machine learning are driving image recognition, autonomous vehicles development, decisions in the financial and energy sectors, advances in medicine, the rise of social networks, and more. Linear regression is an important part of this.

Linear regression is one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning techniques. Whether you want to do statistics, machine learning, or scientific computing, there are good chances that youll need it. Itâ€™s advisable to learn it first and then proceed towards more complex methods.

Regression analysis is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning. Linear regression is one of them.

Linear regression is used for finding linear relationship between target and one or more predictors. There are two types of linear regression- Simple and Multiple.
